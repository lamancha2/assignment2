    <h1>Places in Paris</h1>
    <p>  From its vibrant cities to the gorgeous Italian lakes and coast, the landscapes will get you first. And then there’s the food and culture. There is truly something to enchant everyone.</p>

            <figcaption>Bologna</figcaption>
            <p>Bologna is Italy’s culinary heartland, where all Emilia-Romagna’s great produce congregates. I like that it’s a real working Italian city, with relatively few foreign visitors— and yet it also has such a well-preserved historic core with some stunning architecture.</p>

            <figcaption>Milan</figcaption>
            <p>I pictured Milan as an industrial, fashion-conscious city — and it is. But with the Duomo, La Scala, and many galleries, it also feels like a cultural and artistic hub. Plus, it’s very easy to navigate.</p>

                The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. It was constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair.</p>

            <p>Rome is one of my favorite cities in Italy. It is really beautiful. There is nowhere quite as magical as the lagoon city, from the quiet campos to the splendor of the Grand Canal</p>
